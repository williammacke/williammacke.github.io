<p>
My research area is multi agent systems and reinforcement learning. My experience consists several multi-agent projects, including one involving game theory and another on multi UAV collaboration. In addition I have also done a project on optimization with respect to Kidney Exchanges. I also have a background in deep learning and AI in general. This includes but is not limited to coursework involving backpropagation, classification and convolutional neural networks. I have hidden talents in graphics programming.

<p>
Three potential topics I'd be interested in working on are:

<p>
(1) Policy-search methods

<p>
(2) Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning/Evolution

<p>
(3) Generative Adversarial Network (GAN/Cycle GAN)

<p>
I have not yet teamed up with anyone.
